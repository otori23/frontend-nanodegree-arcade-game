## Frogger game

The objective of the game is to move the player character from the grass region at the bottom 
of the game board, to the water region at the top of the game board.

Open index.html, in a web browser, to begin game play.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player on the game board.

The game board displays the player's score and health statistics. The player's score is displayed 
on the top left, and the player's health is displayed on the top right.

The player can collect items on the game board. The collectable items are randomly selected and 
placed on the game board. These items are:
* **Heart**: adds +1 to player's health status
* **Blue Gem**: adds +1 to player's score
* **Green Gem**: adds +3 to player's score
* **Orange Gem**: adds +5 to player's score

The placement of collectables happens at the beginning of the game, and on successfully reaching 
the water region.

When the player's health status reaches 0, then game play ends. Press the "Esc" key to start a new
game session.
